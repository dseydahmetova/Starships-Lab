# Intro
In the lesson earlier you:

Learned to consume a third-party API in React and invoke the call to that API using the useEffecthook.
Created a "service" module to organize fetchcalls within.
In this lab, you'll consume the Star Wars APILinks to an external site. and render its data.

 

# Setup
* To get set up for this lesson:

- Use `create-react-app` to create a React app named `react-star-wars`
`cd` into `react-star-warsand` open VS Code.
- Open a terminal in VS Code.
- Start the React Dev Server.

# Exercises
Styling in this lab is secondary to completing the functionality

Research documentation of *SWAPI* Links to an external site. to find the endpoint for the starshipsresource.
Create a `services/sw-api`.jsservice module and ensure that all API/fetch calls are made from this module.
Use named exports to expose AJAX functionality as needed, e.g., `export function getAllStarships() {...}`to obtain all starships.
Obtain all of the starships from the API and render in <App>a card for each starship.
Cards should contain the text of the starship's name.

* For example:

## Hints
- Hold the starship objects in state with the `useStatehook`, don't forget to initialize to an `empty` array!
- Use the `useEffecthook` to make the AJAX request once the app loads.
- Once the starship data comes from the API, be sure to update state with the `setter` function.
- Create and import a `StarShipCard`component into App.js.
- `.map()over` each starship object in state to transform them into a <StarshipCard /> component
- CORS issue? Try changing your `/starship` send point to /`starships/`ðŸ‘ˆ trust us on that one ðŸ˜Ž.



* Bonus
- Display additional details for each Starship in it's respectable card.
- This API has a pagination feature that allows you to get additional starships to display - find out how to use this to your advantage and allow users to get more starships at the click of a button
- Here's an informative article on paginationLinks to an external site.
